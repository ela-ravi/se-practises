The \\ntall structure is usually a fixed object, such \\nas a building, bridge or crane; but it is also \\npossible to jump from a  movable object, \\nsuch as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter, \\nthat has the ability to hover above the \\nground. The thrill comes from the free-\\nfalling and the rebound. When the person \\njumps, the cord stretches and the jumper \\nflies upwards again as the cord recoils, and \\ncontinues to oscillate up and down until \\nall the kinetic energy is dissipated.\\nJumping Heights, located in Mohan \\nChatti village, in Rishikesh has been \\nrated as one of the most preferred Bungee \\nJumping destinations in India at a height \\nof 83 meters. It is the only place in India \\nwhere Bungee Jumping can be done from \\na fixed platform. This is also India’s only \\nfixed platform Bungee performed from a \\nprofessional cantilever, to separate it from \\nentertainment parks, and create instead, \\nan extreme adventure zone. The Bungee \\nhas been designed by David Allardice of \\nNew Zealand.\\nThe Cantilever platform is built over \\na rocky cliff over-looking the river Hall, \\na tributary of River Ganges. Bungee-\\ning amidst the vastness of nature lends \\nan absolutely breath taking experience. \\n10th English_Unit_1.indd   8\\n28-11-2022   18:18:44'),\n",

By virtue of his \\nart, he had released many good spirits \\nfrom a witch called Sycorax who had \\nthem imprisoned in the bodies of large \\ntrees. These gentle spirits were ever after \\nobedient to the will of Prospero. Of these \\nAriel was the chief.\\nAriel took rather too much pleasure \\nin tormenting an ugly monster called \\nCaliban, because he was the son of his old \\nenemy Sycorax. Caliban was employed \\nlike a slave, to fetch wood, and do the most \\nlaborious offices; and Ariel had the charge \\nof compelling him to these services.\\nWith the help of these spirits, \\nProspero could command the winds, and \\nthe waves of the sea. By his orders they \\nraised a violent storm, in the midst of \\nwhich, he showed his daughter a fine large \\nship, which he told her was full of living \\nbeings like themselves. “Oh my dear \\nfather,” said she, “if by \\nyour art you have raised \\nthis dreadful storm, have \\npity on their sad distress. \\nSee! the vessel will be \\ndashed to pieces. Poor \\nsouls! they will all perish.”\\n“Be \\nnot \\nso \\namazed, \\ndaughter \\nMiranda,” said Prospero; “there is no \\nharm done. I have so ordered it, that no \\nperson in the ship shall receive any hurt. \\nWhat I have done has been in care of you, \\nmy dear child. You are ignorant. Can you \\nremember a time before you came to this \\ncell? I think you cannot, for you were not \\nthen three years of age.”\\n10th English_Unit_1.indd   21\\n28-11-2022   18:18:48\"),\n",

The opportunity \\nI gave him of making himself popular \\namong my subjects awakened in his bad \\nnature a proud ambition to deprive me of \\nmy dukedom: this he soon effected with \\nthe aid of the King of Naples, a powerful \\nprince, who was my enemy.”\\n“Wherefore,” said Miranda, “did they \\nnot that hour destroy us?”\\n“My child,” answered her father, \\n“they dared not, so dear was the love that \\nmy people bore me. Antonio carried us \\non board a ship, and when we were some \\nleagues out at sea, he forced us into a small \\nboat, without either tackle, sail, or mast: \\nthere he left us, as he thought, to perish. \\nBut a kind lord of my court, one Gonzalo, \\nwho loved me, had privately placed in the \\nboat, water, provisions, apparel, and some \\nbooks which I prize above my dukedom.”\\n“O my father,” said Miranda, “what a \\ntrouble must I have been to you then!”\\n“No, my love,” said Prospero, “you \\nwere a little angel that did preserve me. \\nYour innocent smiles made me bear up \\nagainst my misfortunes. Our food lasted \\ntill we landed on this desert island, since \\nwhen my chief delight has been in teaching \\nyou, Miranda, and well have you profited \\nby my instructions.”\\n“Heaven thank you, my dear father,” \\nsaid Miranda. “Now tell me, sir, your \\nreason for raising this sea-storm?”\\n“Know then,” said her father, “that by \\nmeans of this storm, my enemies, the King \\nof Naples, and my cruel brother, are cast \\nashore upon this island.”\\nHaving so said, Prospero gently \\ntouched his daughter with his magic wand, \\nand she fell fast asleep; for the spirit Ariel \\njust then presented himself before his \\nmaster, to give an account of the tempest, \\nand how he had disposed of the ship’s \\ncompany, and though the spirits were \\nalways invisible to Miranda, Prospero did \\nnot choose she should hear him holding \\nconversation (as would seem to her) with \\nthe empty air.\\n“Well, my brave spirit,” said Prospero \\nto Ariel, “how have you performed your \\ntask?”\\nAriel gave a lively description of the \\nstorm, and of the terrors of the mariners; \\nand how the king’s son, Ferdinand, was \\nthe first who leaped into the sea; and \\nhis father thought he saw his dear son \\nswallowed up by the waves and lost. “But \\nhe is safe,” said Ariel, “in a corner of the \\nisle, sadly lamenting the loss of the king, \\nhis father.\\n“That’s my delicate Ariel,” said \\nProspero. “Bring him here: my daughter \\nmust see this young prince.

Now Miranda had \\nnever seen a man before, except her own \\nfather.\\n“Miranda,” said Prospero, “tell me \\nwhat you are looking at yonder.”\\n“O father,” said Miranda, in a strange \\nsurprise, “surely that is a spirit. Lord! How \\nit looks about! Believe me,  it is a beautiful \\ncreature. Is it not a spirit?”\\n“No, girl,” answered her father; “it \\neats, and sleeps, and has senses such as we \\nhave. This young man you see was in the \\nship. He is somewhat altered by grief, or \\nyou might call him a handsome person. He \\nhas lost his companions, and is wandering \\nabout to find them.”\\nMiranda, who thought all men had \\ngrave faces and grey beards like her father, \\nwas delighted with the appearance of this \\nbeautiful young prince; and Ferdinand, \\nseeing such a lovely lady in this desert \\nplace, and from the strange sounds he had \\nheard, expecting nothing but wonders, \\nthought he was upon an enchanted island, \\nand that Miranda was the goddess of the \\nplace, and as such he began to address her.\\nShe timidly answered, she was no \\ngoddess, but a simple maid, and was \\ngoing to give him an account of herself, \\nwhen Prospero interrupted her. He was \\nwell pleased to find they admired each \\nother, but to try Ferdinand’s constancy, \\nhe resolved to throw some difficulties in \\ntheir way: therefore advancing forward, \\nhe addressed the prince with a stern air, \\ntelling him, he came to the island as a spy, \\nto take it from him who was the lord of \\nit. “Follow me,” said he, “I will tie your \\nneck and feet together. You shall drink \\nsea-water; shell-fish, withered roots, and \\nhusks of acorns shall be your food.” “No,” \\nsaid Ferdinand, “I will resist this” and \\ndrew his sword; but Prospero, waving his \\nmagic wand, fixed him to the spot where \\nhe stood, so that he had no power to move.\\nMiranda hung upon her father, \\nsaying, “Why are you so ungentle? Have \\npity, sir; I will be his surety. This is the \\nsecond man I ever saw, and to me he seems \\na true one.”\\n“Silence,” said the father: “one word \\nmore will make me chide you, girl! What! \\nAn advocate for an impostor! You think \\nthere are no more such fine men, having \\nseen only him and Caliban.” This he said \\nto prove his daughter’s constancy; and she \\nreplied, “My affections are most humble.

Read the lesson \\nand enjoy the narrator's experience with \\nhis grandfather who creates chaos and \\nlaughter with his imaginative stories.\\nThe ghost that got into our house on \\nthe night of November 17, 1915, raised \\nsuch a hullabaloo of misunderstandings \\nthat I am sorry I didn’t just let it keep on \\nwalking, and go to bed. Its advent caused \\nmy mother to throw a shoe through \\na window of the house next door and \\nended up with my grandfather shooting a \\npatrolman. I am sorry, therefore, as I have \\nsaid, that I ever paid any attention to the \\nfootsteps.\\nThey began about a quarter past one \\no’clock in the morning, a rhythmic, quick-\\ncadenced walking around the dining-\\nroom table. My mother was asleep in \\none room upstairs, my brother-Herman \\nin another, grandfather was in the attic, \\nin the old walnut bed which, as you will \\nremember, once fell on my father. I had just \\nstepped out of the bathtub and was busily \\nrubbing myself with a towel when I heard \\nthe steps. They were the steps of a man \\nwalking rapidly around the dining-table \\ndownstairs. The light from the bathroom \\nshone \\ndown \\nthe \\nback-steps, \\nwhich \\ndropped directly into the dining-room; I \\ncould see the faint shine of plates on the \\nplate-rail; I couldn’t see the table. The \\nsteps kept going round and round the \\ntable; at regular intervals a board creaked, \\nwhen it was trod upon. I supposed at first \\nthat it was my father or my brother Roy, \\nwho had gone to Indianapolis but were \\nexpected home at any time. I suspected \\nnext that it was a burglar. It did not enter \\nmy mind until later that it was a ghost.\\nAfter the walking had gone on \\nfor perhaps three minutes, I tiptoed to \\nHerman’s room. ‘Psst!’ I hissed, in the \\ndark, shaking him. ‘Awp’, he said, in the \\nlow, hopeless tone of a despondent beagle \\n– he always half suspected that something \\nwould ‘get him’ in the night. I told him \\nwho I was. ‘There’s something downstairs!’ \\nI said. He got up and followed me to the \\nhead of the back staircase. The steps had \\nceased. Herman looked at me in some \\nalarm: I had only the bath towel around \\nmy waist. He wanted to go back to bed, I \\ngripped his arm.\\n‘There’s something down there!’ \\nI said. Instantly the steps began again, \\ncircled the dining-room table like a man \\nrunning, and started up the stairs towards \\nus, heavily, two at a time. The light still \\nshone palely down the stairs; we saw \\nnothing coming; we only heard the steps. \\nHerman rushed to his room and slammed \\nthe door. I slammed shut the door at the \\nstairs top and held my knee against it. \\na. \\x07Where was the author when he heard \\nthe noise?\\nb. \\x07What did the narrator think the \\nunusual sound was? \\nProse\\n2\\nThe Night the Ghost Got In \\nJames Grover Thurber\\n10th English_Unit_2.indd   30\\n28-11-2022   18:19:36\"),\n",

There was nothing there. There was \\nno sound. None of us ever heard the ghost \\nagain.\\nThe slamming of the doors had \\naroused mother: she peered out of her \\nroom. ‘What on earth are you boys doing?’ \\nshe demanded. Herman ventured out of \\nhis room. ‘Nothing,’ he said, gruffly, but \\nhe was, in colour, a light green. ‘What was \\nall that running around downstairs?’ said \\nmother. So she had heard the steps, too! \\nWe just looked at her. ‘Burglars!’ she \\nshouted, intuitively. I tried to quieten her \\nby starting lightly downstairs.\\n‘Come on, Herman,’ I said.\\n‘I’ll stay with mother,’ he said. ‘She’s \\nall excited.’ \\nI stepped back onto the landing.\\n‘Don’t either of you go a step,’ said \\nmother. ‘We’ll call the police.’ Since the \\nphone was downstairs, I didn’t see how we \\nwere going to call the police -- nor did I \\nwant the police – but mother made one of \\nher quick, incomparable decisions. She \\nflung up a window of her bedroom which \\nfaced the bedroom windows of the house \\nof a neighbour, picked up a shoe, and \\nwhammed it through a pane of glass across \\nthe narrow space that separated the two \\nhouses. Glass tinkled into the bedroom \\noccupied by a retired engraver named \\nBodwell and his wife. Bodwell had been \\nfor some years in rather a bad way and \\nwas subject to mild ‘attacks’. Almost \\neverybody we knew or lived near had \\nsome kind of attacks.\\nIt was now about two o’clock of a \\nmoonless night; clouds hung black and \\nlow. Bodwell was at the window in a \\nminute, shouting frothing a little, shaking \\nhis fist. ‘We’ll sell the house and go back \\nto Peoria,’ we could hear Mrs. Bodwell \\nsaying. It was some time before mother \\n‘got through’ to Bodwell. ‘Burglars!’ she \\nshouted. ‘Burglars in the house!’ Herman \\nand I hadn’t dared to tell her that it was not \\nburglars but ghosts, for she was even more \\nafraid of ghosts than of burglars. Bodwell \\nat first thought that she meant there were \\nburglars in his house, but finally he quieted \\ndown and called the police for us over an \\nextension phone by his bed. After he had \\ndisappeared from the window, mother \\nsuddenly made as if to throw another \\nshoe, not because there was further need \\nof it but, as she later explained, because \\nthe thrill of heaving a shoe through a \\nwindow glass had enormously taken her \\nfancy. I prevented her.\\nThe police were on hand in a \\ncommendably short time: a Ford sedan \\nfull of them, two on motorcycles, and a \\npatrol wagon with about eight in it and a \\nfew reporters.

Flashlights shot streaks of \\ngleam up and down the walls, across the \\nyard, down the walk between our house \\nand Bodwell’s. ‘Open up!’ cried a hoarse \\nvoice. ‘We’re men from Headquarters!’ I \\nwanted to go down and let them in, since \\nthere they were, but mother wouldn’t hear \\nof it. ‘You haven’t a stitch on,’ she pointed \\nout. ‘You’d catch your death.’ I wound the \\ntowel around me again. Finally the cops \\nput their shoulders to our big heavy front \\ndoor with its thick bevelled glass and \\nbroke it in: I could hear a rending of wood \\nand a splash of glass on the floor of the \\nhall. Their lights played all over the living-\\nroom and crisscrossed nervously in the \\ndining-room, stabbed into hallways, shot \\nup the front stairs and finally up the back. \\nThey caught me standing in my towel at \\nthe top. A heavy policeman bounded up \\nthe steps. ‘Who are you?’ he demanded. ‘I \\nlive here,’ I said.\\nThe officer in charge reported to \\nmother. ‘No sign of nobody, lady,’ he said. \\n‘Musta got away – whatt’d he like?’ ‘There \\nwere two or three of them,’ mother said, \\n‘whooping and carrying on slamming \\ndoors.’ ‘Funny,’ said the cop. ‘All ya \\nwindows and door was locked on the \\ninside tight as a tick.’\\n \\nDownstairs, \\nwe could hear the \\ntromping of the other \\npolice.

A \\nhalf-dozen policemen emerged out of the \\ndarkness of the front hallway upstairs. \\nThey began to ransack the floor; pulled \\nbeds away from walls, tore clothes off \\nhooks in the closets, pulled suitcase and \\nboxes off shelves. One of them found an \\nold zither that Roy had won in a pool \\ntournament. ‘Looky here, Joe,’ he said, \\nstrumming it with a big paw. The cop \\nnamed Joe took it and turned it over. \\n‘What is it?’ he asked me. ‘It’s an old zither \\nour guinea pig used to sleep on,’ I said. It \\nwas true that a pet guinea pig we once had \\nwould never sleep anywhere except on the \\nzither, but I should never have said so. \\nJoe and the other cop looked at me a long \\ntime. They put the zither back on a shelf. \\n‘No sign o’ nothing’, said the cop \\nwho had first spoken to mother, ‘The \\nlady seems hysterical.’ They all nodded, \\nbut said nothing; just looked at me. In \\nthe small silence we all heard a creaking \\nin the attic. Grandfather was turning \\nover in bed. ‘What’s that?’ snapped Joe. \\nFive or six cops sprang for the attic door \\nbefore I could intervene or explain. \\nI realized that it would be bad if they \\nburst in on grandfather unannounced, or \\neven announced. He was going through a \\nphase in which he believed that General \\nMeade’s men, under steady hammering \\nby Stonewall Jackson, were beginning to \\nretreat and even desert.\\nWhen I got to the attic, things were \\npretty \\nconfused. \\nGrandfather \\nhad \\nevidently jumped to the conclusion that \\nthe police were deserters from Meade’s \\narmy, trying to hide away in his attic.

The cops must have realized at once \\nthat the indignant white-haired old man \\nbelonged to the house, but they had no \\nchance to say so. ‘Back, ye cowardly dog!’ \\nroared grandfather. ‘Back t’ the lines ye \\ngoodaam Lily-livered cattle!’ With that, \\nhe fetched the officer who found the zither \\na flat – handed smack alongside his head \\nthat sent him sprawling. The others beat a \\nretreat, but not enough; grandfather \\ngrabbed zither’s gun from its holster and \\nlet fly. The report seemed to crack the \\nrafters; smoke filled the attic. A cop cursed \\nand shot his hand to his shoulder. \\nSomehow, we all finally got downstairs \\nagain and locked the door against the old \\ngentleman. He fired once or twice more in \\nthe darkness and then went back to bed. \\n‘That was grandfather’, I explained to Joe, \\nout of breath. ‘He thinks you’re deserter.’ \\n‘I’ll say he does,’ said Joe.\\nThe cops were reluctant to leave \\nwithout getting their hand on somebody \\nbesides grandfather; the night had been \\ndistinctly a defeat for them. Furthermore, \\nthey obviously didn’t like the ‘layout’; \\nsomething looked – and I can see their \\nviewpoint – phony. They began to poke \\ninto things again. A reporter, a thin-faced, \\nwispy man, came up to me. I had put on \\none of mother’s dress, not being able to \\nfind anything else.

I told her he was a \\ndeserter. ‘Of all things!’ said mother. ‘He \\nwas such a nice-looking young man’.\\nGrandfather was fresh as a daisy and \\nfull of jokes at breakfast next morning. \\nWe thought at first he had forgotten all \\nabout what had happened, but he hadn’t. \\nOver his third cup of coffee, he glared at \\nHerman and me. ‘What was the idea of all \\nthe cops tarryhootin’ around the house \\nlast night?’ he demanded.

Two \\nyears later, in 1913, Chaplin signed his very \\nfirst contract at Keystone and it was no \\ntime before he headed to Hollywood.  His \\nfirst movie premiered in 1914, “Making \\na Living,” and went on to make over 35 \\nmovies total in that year alone.  Charlie \\nChaplin grew to become one of the most \\npopular and successful actors of all time. \\nThe moment that really kicked off his long \\ncareer was in 1921 when he starred in, and \\nproduced, his first full length film called \\n“The Kid.”  From then on, most people all \\nover the world knew Charlie Chaplin and \\nloved his movies.  He had a great career and \\nlife, dying on December 25, 1977, in Vevey, \\nSwitzerland.

Zigzag must \\nbe Uncle Somu’s pet snake. The African \\nsidewinder! You know, the one that slithers \\nZigzag all over his house!’\\n‘You’re both quite mistaken,’ their \\nfather hastened to explain, seeing his \\nwife’s horrified expression. ‘Zigzag is a \\nmost harmless, unusual and lovable bird. \\nApparently, it was bred by a genuine \\nAfrican witch doctor, who gifted it to Somu \\nwhen he-------being a child specialist like \\nme -----------cured the witch doctor’s son \\nwhile he was touring the deepest jungles \\nof equatorial Africa last month. Somu \\nsays the bird is an absolute treasure and a \\nreal help. It’s his favourite pet, you know’.\\nSomu might be your best friend, \\nbut most of these so called “favourite” \\npossessions that he has given us were \\nabsolute \\nnuisances!’ \\ncountered \\nMrs.\\nKrishnan angrily.

Tara-Tarini is the patron deity for \\nsailors and is worshipped for safety and \\nsuccess at sea.\\nINSV Tarini is the second sailboat of \\nthe Indian Navy (The first being the INSV \\nMhadei). It is a 55 foot sailing vessel built \\nindigenously in India by M/s Aquarius \\nShipyard Pvt. Ltd, located in Goa. After \\nundergoing extensive sea trials, she was \\ncommissioned to the Indian Navy service \\non 18 February 2017. The boat was named \\nafter the famous ‘Tara-Tarini’ temple in \\nGanjam district of Odisha. The word \\n‘Tarini’ means ‘boat’ and in Sanskrit it \\nmeans ‘Saviour’. \\nINSV Tarini has an advanced \\nRaymarine navigation suite and an array \\nof satellite communication systems for \\nperfect navigation anywhere in world.\\nNavika Sagar Parikrama was a \\nproject undertaken in consonance with \\nthe National policy to empower women \\nto attain their full potential. “The Project \\nis considered essential towards promoting \\nocean sailing activities in the Navy while \\ndepicting Government of India’s thrust for \\nNari Shakti (women power),” said Chief \\nof the Naval Staff, Admiral Sunil Lanba in \\nhis welcome speech.\\nThe voyage was aimed to showcase \\n‘Make in India’ initiative by sailing on-\\nboard indigenously built INSV Tarini. \\nThe special feature of this sailboat was \\nthat it encouraged the use of environment \\nfriendly \\nnon-conventional \\nrenewable \\nenergy resources such as the wind; \\ncollected and updated meteorological, \\nocean and wave data on regular basis \\nfor accurate weather forecast by India \\nMeteorological Department (IMD) and \\nalso collected data for monitoring marine \\npollution on high seas.\\na.

It was a \\nhistoric day, which would be marked in \\nnavigation history and globally. It covered \\nthe expedition in five legs with stop-\\novers at four ports (Fremantle, Australia; \\nLyttleton, New Zealand; Port Stanley, the \\nFalklands and Cape Town, South Africa) \\nfor replenishment of ration and repair \\nas necessary, before returning to Goa in \\nApril 2018. They went around the globe \\nwithin 254-days and reached Goa port \\non 21 May 2018. The six member women \\ncrew broke many stereotypes during their \\nrecord-setting sail.\\nAn Interview with the crew members\\nIndia’s all-women navy crew who \\nwent around the world in 254-days have \\nshared their experiences about their great \\nvoyage in an interview. Through their \\npersonal experiences, we really come to \\nknow their hardships and unpredictable \\nchallenges they have faced all through their \\nexpeditions.\\nInterviewer: \\nHow \\nwell \\nwere \\nyou \\nacquainted with the sail boat before you \\ntook up the task?\\nVartika Joshi: None of us was \\nacquainted with a sail boat or ocean-going \\nboat; none of us had sailed before, nor are \\nwoman officers allowed entry in combat \\nplatforms as yet. At first, it was difficult \\nto take the boat out to sea, from one point \\nto another. But we slowly built upon it \\nthrough three years of training.\\nThe \\nfirst \\nIndian \\nsolo \\ncircumnavigation was undertaken by \\nCapt.

So, we were given hands-on \\ntraining, like, how to repair things and how \\nto deal with emergencies, when the weather \\ngets rough, if there is a medical emergency, \\nand training was needed in tactical aspects \\nas well.\\nAishwarya: We underwent our basic \\nsail training courses in Mumbai at the \\nIndian Naval Waterman ship Training \\nCentre (INWTC), and at various schools in \\nthe southern naval base in Kochi. We even \\nsailed on INSV Mhadei to Mauritius (in \\n2016 and 2017) and back and also to Cape \\nTown in December 2016. We were trained \\nfor almost three years to prepare for the \\nvoyage. Since the boat was old, it had minor \\nleaks and repairs. Also, we ran out of water \\nand food soon. So the trip was a tutorial for \\nus on how to manage food, water and even \\nelectricity during the big voyage.\\nInterviewer: What was the selection \\nprocess? \\nAishwarya: Out of the thirty women \\nwho had applied, six of us were shortlisted, \\nbased on the little survival skills we \\nshowcased. The crew was mentored by \\nCommander Dilip Donde. But after I was \\ntold about the flare-ups at sea, I even had \\nsecond thoughts about joining the team.\\nInterviewer: \\nHow \\ndid \\nyour \\nfamily \\nmembers react when you told them about \\nthis expedition?  \\nVartika Joshi: Our families did have \\na hard time, but that was because most of \\nthem had never even seen the sea! Four \\nof us are from the mountains. The first \\ntime my parents saw the ocean was when I \\ninvited them to visit. But once they saw that \\nwe’re doing well and looking after ourselves, \\nthey were quite supportive.

I didn’t set out for a destination; \\nit was the journey that mattered to me the \\nmost. So my contention was to make sure \\nthat we go by the rules of\\xa0circumnavigation \\nwhich say that you don’t have to use any \\nauxiliary means of repulsion and you don’t \\nhave to take anybody else’s assistance. I \\ngrasped that completely. \\nInterviewer: Name that one quality of \\nyours that enabled you to complete this \\nexpedition successfully? \\nVartika Joshi: Whenever the winds \\ndropped, it wouldn’t have taken me even a \\nfraction of second to switch on the engine \\nand say let’s go one mile ahead. But inside \\nof me something poked me and said \\nthat you have to be honest with yourself \\nand this expedition has to be done with \\nhonesty. I am glad that we were able to \\nfinish it successfully without the use of \\nthe engine at all.\\nInterviewer: As the head of the crew, \\nhow did you involve the team?\\nVartika Joshi: We’ve all sailed and \\ntrained the same amount, and everybody \\nhas their own way of dealing with \\nsituations, but that was a good thing, \\nd. \\x07Where did the crew undergo their \\nbasic training?\\ne. \\x07How long were they trained to \\nundertake this voyage?\\nf. \\x07Which skill was considered important \\nin the selection process?\\ng. \\x07Who mentored the crew? \\nbecause we could discuss different ways \\nof solving a problem and choose the best \\none. In fact, I’d say it was easier for us to \\ncollaborate and work together.\\nPayal Gupta: When you are out at \\nsea, teamwork is the most important in \\nthe middle of the crisis. Even during the \\nstorm when three people would be out on \\nwatch, the other three who would be inside \\nwouldn’t be able to rest. Somebody would \\nheat the water, the other person would heat \\nthe gloves because it was raining also. So \\nteam effort actually helped in navigating \\nthrough the 20 hours long storm. I feel that \\nif I had been alone then it would have been \\na nightmare to deal with the challenges \\nthat the sea throws at you.\\nInterviewer: Share your experience about \\nthe most challenging task while sailing.\\nVartika Joshi: The Sea can get really \\ntough when winds are picking up. Those \\nare the times we have to be active and need \\nto anticipate what could be there ahead. In \\nthe South Pacific, we encountered a storm \\nwhere the seas were almost nine to ten \\nmeters high and the winds were picking up \\nto 60–70 knots(a unit of speed equal to one \\nnautical mile per hour exactly 1.852km/h), \\nwhich is about a hurricane force of wind \\non land. It is normal on sea where there is \\nhardly any land mass to stop the winds.\\nIt was also a blissful experience when \\nsomething broke down and after a lot of \\nhard work and effort, we were able to fix it \\ntogether. We will remember these incidents \\nas well because they gave us the strength \\nto move on and if something went bad, we \\nwere able to overcome those challenges. \\n10th English_Unit_3.indd   63\\n28-11-2022   18:20:29'),\n",

It was \\nrare to watch that in those months, that too \\nfrom sea. We were absolutely awestruck \\nas we were not expecting it, to see the \\nentire sky lit up in green light. There was \\nbio-luminescence, dolphins swimming in \\nthe wake of the boat like our neighbours \\nand a variety of sea creatures. We spotted \\na dead sperm whale once and we thought \\nit was an island from a distance, it was so \\nhuge. We are not specialists, so whenever \\nwe spotted something in the sea, we had to \\nGoogle it to learn more about the species.\\nInterviewer: How did your crew spend \\ntime deep in the sea?\\nSwathi P: During circumnavigation, \\nwe picked up some hobbies and kept \\nposting pictures of delicacies like golgappas \\nand cakes. We also read books when the \\nweather was pleasant and did some quilling \\nand craft work. While team leader Joshi \\nread comics and the Ramayana during \\nher journey, I loved cooking as well so I \\nindulged in baking. I also liked crafting a \\nlot, so I used to make lampshades. I love \\nit when people appreciate the food that I \\ncook, so I gave my crew members the best \\ndishes that was possible on land with the \\nlimited resources that we had on the boat.\\nVartika Joshi: Six is a great number, \\nwe were always entertained. We watched \\nmovies, listened to music, and you won’t \\nbelieve some of the goodies the crew \\nrustled up in our tiny pantry, even while \\nsailing in rough seas. We made parathas, \\nbaked cakes and breads, and even made \\nhalwa and rasgullas!\\nWe celebrated festivals at sea. \\nWhen we think about it now on land, we \\nremember the Diwali we spent at sea. We \\ncelebrated three birthdays including the \\nfirst birthday of the boat; also specific \\noccasions like crossing the equator, the \\nInternational Date Line and such. \\nInterviewer: What motivated you to \\nfulfil the country’s expectations?  \\nSwathi P: We knew that the entire \\ncountry was watching us and praying for \\nus, so we never wanted them to have a \\nsingle day thinking that we are in trouble. \\nWe knew that it is going to happen but \\nthe people out there did not know what \\nkind of challenges we were facing. So, one \\nof the motives that we kept in mind was \\nthat we did not want to frighten them. We \\ndecided that once the circumnavigating \\nwas over, we are going to show what we \\nhave actually gone through.\\nInterviewer: As a woman, how would \\nyou consider this expedition?\\nVartika Joshi: It is a matter of great \\nhonour and we couldn’t have imagined \\nanything better for our cast-off. Of course \\nwe being an all-woman team, it is a great \\nboost to women in the country. But, as we \\nare going as sailors, and we as sailors have \\nseen that the sea does not discriminate \\nbetween genders. It is always gender-\\nneutral and we have realised that gender \\ndoes not play a role in sailing. But to boost \\nthe morale in the country and for more \\nwomen to take in adventures like sailing, I \\nfeel it is great that an all-woman team had \\nbeen formed to undergo this expedition.\\n10th English_Unit_3.indd   64\\n28-11-2022   18:20:29'),\n",

The Emperor said \\nthat one man from each Chinese family \\nmust leave his family to join the army. \\nMulan, a teenage girl who lived in a \\nfaraway village of China, heard the news \\nwhen she was outside, washing clothes. \\nMulan ran into the house.  Her father \\nwas sitting in a chair, carving a piece of \\nwood. “Father!” she said. “Did you hear \\nwhat the Emperor says each family must \\ndo?” \\n“Yes,” said her old father, “I heard \\nabout it in town.  Well, I may as well go \\npack up.”  He put down his carving, stood \\nup and walked very slowly to his room.  \\nSupplementary\\n3\\nThe Story of Mulan\\n“Wait!” said Mulan, “Father, you \\nhave not been well.  If I may say so, why at \\nyour age must you keep up with all those \\nyoung men?”\\n“What else can be done?” said her \\nfather.  “Your brother is a child.  He cannot \\ngo.”\\n“Of course that\\'s true,” said Mulan. \\n“He is too little.  But I have an idea.” She \\npoured her father a cup of tea and handed \\nit to him. “Father, have some tea. Please sit \\nfor a minute. I will be right back.” \\n\"Very well, dear,\" said the father.\\nMulan went into her room. With her \\nsword, she cut off her long, black hair. She \\nput on her father’s robe.  Going back to \\nher father, Mulan said, “Look at me.  I am \\nyour son now.  I will go in your place.  I \\nwill do my part for China.” \\n“No, my daughter!” said the old man. \\n“You cannot do this!”\\n10th English_Unit_3.indd   88\\n28-11-2022   18:20:38'),\n",

If they find out you are a \\nwoman, you know as well as I do that you \\nwill die!”\\n“No one will find out, Father,” said \\nMulan.  She picked up her sword.\\n\"Mulan!\" said the Father.  He tried to \\nget up but had to hold on to his chair.  \\nThe daughter kissed him goodbye.  \"I \\nlove you, Father,\" she said.  \"Take care of \\nyourself.  Tell my brother I said goodbye.\" \\nShe climbed on a family horse.  And off \\nshe went to join the Emperor’s army.\\nIn the army, Mulan proved to be \\na brave soldier.  In time, she was put in \\ncharge of other soldiers.  Her battles went \\nso well that she was put in charge of more \\nsoldiers.  Her battles kept on going well. \\nAfter a few years Mulan was given the top \\njob – she would be General of the entire \\narmy.  \\nNot long after that, a very bad fever \\nswept through the army.  Many soldiers \\nwere sick.  And Mulan, the General of the \\narmy, became sick, too.  \\nWhen the doctor came out of Mulan\\'s \\ntent, he knew the truth.\\n“The General is a woman?” yelled \\nthe soldiers.  “How can this be?”  Some \\ncalled out, “She tricked us!” and “We will \\nnot fight for a woman!” They said, “Punish \\nher!  Make her pay!  The cost is for her to \\ndie!” But others called out, in voices just as \\nloud, “With Mulan, we win every battle!” \\nThey said, “Stay away from our General!”\\nJust \\nthen, \\na \\nsoldier \\nran \\nup. \\n“Everyone!\" he called.  \"A surprise attack \\nis coming!”   \\nMulan heard this from inside her \\ntent.  She got dressed and went outside. \\nShe was not yet strong, but stood tall.  She \\ntold the soldiers where they must go to \\nhide so they could attack when the enemy \\ncame.  But they must get there fast!  The \\nsoldiers, even those who did not like that \\ntheir General was a woman, could tell that \\nMulan knew what she was talking about. \\nIt worked! The battle was won.  It was \\nsuch a big victory that the enemy gave up, \\nat last. The war was over, and China was \\nsaved! You can be sure that after that last \\nbattle, no one cared anymore that Mulan \\nwas a woman.\\nThe Emperor was so glad that Mulan \\nhad ended the long war, he set aside the \\nrule about being a woman.  “Mulan, stay \\nwith me in the palace,” he said. “Someone \\nas smart as you would be a fine royal \\nadviser.”  \\nMulan bowed deeply.  “You are too \\nkind, Sire,” she said.  “But if you please, \\nwhat I wish most of all is to return home \\nto my family.”\\n“Then at least take these fine gifts,” \\nsaid the Emperor. \"So everyone at your \\nhome and village will know how much the \\nEmperor of China thinks of you.”\\nMulan returned to her village with six \\nfine horses and six fine swords. Everyone \\ncheered that she was safe.  The person \\nwho had saved China was their very own \\nMulan!\\n10th English_Unit_3.indd   89\\n28-11-2022   18:20:38'),\n",

He authored several \\nshort stories and novels meant primarily \\nfor young children and teenagers. \\nHe revived the children’s magazine \\n‘Sandesh’ (which his grandfather had \\nstarted in 1913) and edited it until his \\ndeath in 1992.

It highlights \\nthat the aged are sharp \\nwitted.  It describes the \\nlove and affection a son and his mother \\nhave for one another.\\nLong, long ago there lived at the foot of \\nthe mountain a poor farmer and his aged, \\nwidowed mother. They owned a bit of land \\nwhich supplied them with food, and they \\nwere humble, peaceful, and happy.\\nThe country Shining was governed by \\na despotic leader who though a warrior, \\nhad a great and cowardly shrinking from \\nanything suggestive of failing health and \\nstrength. This caused him to send out a \\ncruel proclamation. The entire province \\nwas given strict orders to immediately \\nput to death all aged people. Those \\nwere barbarous days, and the custom of \\nabandoning old people to die was not \\nuncommon. The poor farmer loved his \\naged mother with tender reverence, and \\nthe order filled his heart with sorrow. \\nBut no one ever thought twice about \\nobeying the mandate of the governor, so \\nwith many deep and hopeless sighs, the \\nyouth prepared for what at that time was \\nconsidered the kindest mode of death.\\nJust at sundown, when his day’s \\nwork was ended, he took a quantity of \\nunwhitened rice which was the principal \\nfood for the poor, and he cooked, dried \\nit, and tied it in a square cloth, which he \\nswung in a bundle around his neck along \\nwith a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. \\nThen he lifted his helpless old mother to \\nhis back and started on his painful journey \\nup the mountain. The road was long and \\nsteep; the narrow road was crossed and re-\\ncrossed by many paths made by the hunters \\nand woodcutters. In some place, they lost \\nand confuses, but he gave no heed. One path \\nor another, it mattered not. On he went, \\nclimbing blindly upward -- ever upward \\ntowards the high bare summit of what is \\nknown as Obatsuyama, the mountain of \\nthe “abandoning of the aged”.\\nThe eyes of the old mother were not \\nso dim but that they noted the reckless \\nhastening from one path to another, and \\nher loving heart grew anxious. Her son \\ndid not know the mountain’s many paths \\nand his return might be one of danger, so \\nshe stretched forth her hand and snapping \\nthe twigs from brushes as they passed, \\nshe quietly dropped a handful every few \\nsteps of the way so that as they climbed, \\n10th English_Unit_4.indd   120\\n28-11-2022   18:21:50'),\n",

At last the summit was reached. \\nWeary and heart sick, the youth gently \\nreleased his burden and silently prepared \\na place of comfort as his last duty to the \\nloved one. Gathering fallen pine needles, \\nhe made a soft cushion and tenderly \\nlifted his old mother onto it. He wrapped \\nher padded coat more closely about the \\nstooping shoulders and with tearful eyes \\nand an aching heart he said farewell.\\nThe trembling mother’s voice was \\nfull of unselfish love as she gave her last \\ninjunction. “Let not thine eyes be blinded, \\nmy son.” She said. “The mountain road \\nis full of dangers. LOOK carefully and \\nfollow the path which holds the piles of \\ntwigs. They will guide you to the familiar \\npath farther down”. The son’s surprised \\neyes looked back over the path, then at \\nthe poor old, shriveled hands all scratched \\nand soiled by their work of love. His heart \\nbroke within and bowing to the ground, \\nhe cried aloud: “Oh, honorable mother, \\nyour kindness breaks my heart! I will not \\nleave you. Together we will follow the path \\nof twigs, and together we will die!”\\nOnce more he shouldered his burden \\n(how light it seemed now) and hastened \\ndown the path, through the shadows and \\nthe moonlight, to the little hut in the \\nvalley. Beneath the kitchen floor was a \\nwalled closet for food, which was covered \\nand hidden from view. There the son hid \\nhis mother, supplying her with everything \\nshe needed, continually watching and \\nfearing she would be discovered. Time \\npassed, and he was beginning to feel safe \\nwhen again the governor sent forth heralds \\nbearing an unreasonable order, seemingly \\nas a boast of his power. His demand was \\nthat his subjects should present him with \\na rope of ashes.\\nThe entire province trembled with \\ndread. The order must be obeyed yet \\nwho in all Shining could make a rope of \\nashes? One night, in great distress, the son \\nwhispered the news to his hidden mother. \\n“Wait!” she said. “I will think. I will think” \\nOn the second day she told him what to \\ndo. “Make rope of twisted straw,” she said. \\n“Then stretch it upon a row of flat stones \\nand burn it on a windless night.” He called \\nthe people together and did as she said and \\nwhen the blaze died down, there upon the \\nstones, with every twist and fiber showing \\nperfectly, lay a rope of ashes.\\nThe governor was pleased at the wit \\nof the youth and praised greatly, but he \\ndemanded to know where he had obtained \\nhis wisdom. “Alas! Alas!” cried the farmer, \\n“the truth must be told!” and with deep \\nbows he related his story. The governor \\nlistened and then meditated in silence. \\nFinally he lifted his head. “Shining needs \\nmore than strength of youth,” he said \\ngravely. “Ah, that I should have forgotten \\nthe well-known saying, “with the crown of \\nsnow, there cometh wisdom!” That very \\nhour the cruel law was abolished, and \\n10th English_Unit_4.indd   121\\n28-11-2022   18:21:50'),\n",

One of the Earth \\nHerald’s astronomers had just determined \\nthe elements of the new planet Gandini. \\nIt is at a distance of 12,841,348,284,623 \\nmetres and 7 decimetres that this planet \\ndescribes its orbit round the sun in 572 \\nyears, 194 days, 12 hours, 43 minutes, 9.8 \\nseconds. Francis Bennett was delighted \\nwith such precision.\\n‘Good!’ he exclaimed. ‘Hurry up and \\ntell the reportage service about it. You \\nknow what a passion the public has for \\nthese astronomical questions. I’m anxious \\nfor the news to appear in today’s issue!’\\nThe next room, a broad gallery about \\na quarter of a mile long, was devoted to \\npublicity, and it well may be imagined \\nwhat the publicity for such a journal as \\nthe Earth Herald had to be. It brought in \\na daily average of three million dollars. \\nThey are gigantic signs reflected on the \\nclouds, so large that they can be seen all \\nover a whole country. From that gallery \\na thousand projectors were unceasingly \\nemployed in sending to the clouds, on \\nwhich they were reproduced in colour, \\nthese inordinate advertisements.\\nAt that moment the clock struck twelve. \\nThe director of the Earth Herald left the \\nhall and sat down in a rolling armchair. In \\na few minutes he had reached his dining \\nroom half a mile away, at the far end of \\nthe office.\\nThe table was laid and he took his place \\nat it. Within reach of his hand was placed \\na series of taps and before him was the \\ncurved surface of a phonotelephote, on \\nwhich appeared the dining room of his \\nhome in Paris.

It was so warm, so bright! \\nThe birds were chirping at the edge of the \\nwoods; and in the open field back of the \\nsawmill the Prussian soldiers were drilling. \\nIt was all much more tempting than the \\nrule for participles, but I had the strength \\nto resist, and hurried off to school. \\nWhen I passed the town hall there \\nwas a crowd in front of the bulletin-board. \\nFor the last two years all our bad news had \\ncome from there — the lost battles, the \\ndraft, the orders of the commanding \\nofficer — and I thought to myself, without \\nstopping, “What can be the matter now?”\\nThis lesson is set in the days of France-Prussian war. France was ruled by Bismarck. \\nPrussia then consisted of what now are the nations of Germany, Polland, and parts of \\nAustria. The Prussians defeated the French and the districts of Alsace and Lorraine \\nfell into the hands of the Prussians. The oppressors not only wanted the territory but \\ndominated over the language and culture of the Germans, thus to take away their \\nidentity.

Hamel’s little garden all \\nout of breath. \\nUsually, when school began, there \\nwas a great bustle, which could be heard \\nout in the street, the opening and closing \\nof desks, lessons repeated in unison, very \\nloud, with our hands over our ears to \\nunderstand better, and the teacher’s great \\nruler rapping on the table. But now it was \\nall so still! I had counted on the commotion \\nto get to my desk without being seen; but, \\nof course, that day everything had to be \\nas quiet as Sunday morning. Through \\nthe window I saw my classmates, already \\nin their places, and M. Hamel walking \\nup and down with his terrible iron ruler \\nunder his arm. I had to open the door and \\ngo in before everybody. You can imagine \\nhow I blushed and how frightened I was. \\nBut nothing happened. M. Hamel \\nsaw me and said very kindly, “Go to \\nyour place quickly, little Franz. We were \\nbeginning without you.” \\nI jumped over the bench and sat \\ndown at my desk. Not till then, when I had \\ngot a little over my fright, did I see that our \\na. \\x07What kind of news was usually put up \\non the bulletin board? \\nb. \\x07What was the usual scene when school \\nbegan everyday?\\nteacher had on his beautiful green coat, his \\nfrilled shirt, and the little black silk cap, all \\nembroidered, that he never wore except \\non inspection and prize days. Besides, \\nthe whole school seemed so strange and \\nsolemn. But the thing that surprised me \\nmost was to see, on the back benches that \\nwere always empty, the village people \\nsitting quietly like ourselves; old Hauser, \\nwith his three-cornered hat, the former \\nmayor, the former postmaster, and several \\nothers besides. Everybody looked sad; \\nand Hauser had brought an old primer, \\nthumbed at the edges, and he held it open \\non his knees with his great spectacles lying \\nacross the pages. \\nWhile I was wondering about it all, \\nM. Hamel mounted his chair, and, in the \\nsame grave and gentle tone which he had \\nused to me, said, “My children, this is the \\nlast lesson I shall give you. The order has \\ncome from Berlin to teach only German \\nin the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The \\nnew master comes tomorrow. This is your \\nlast French lesson.

But I got mixed \\nup on the first words and stood there, \\nholding on to my desk, my heart beating, \\nand not daring to look up. \\nc. \\x07Other than the students, who were \\npresent in the class?\\nd. \\x07Why did M. Hamel say it was the last \\nFrench lesson?\\nI heard M. Hamel say to me, “I won’t \\nscold you, little Franz; you must feel bad \\nenough. See how it is! Every day we have \\nsaid to ourselves, ‘Bah! I’ve plenty of time. \\nI’ll learn it tomorrow.’ And now you see \\nwhere we’ve come out. Ah, that’s the great \\ntrouble with Alsace; she puts off learning \\ntill tomorrow. Now those fellows out there \\nwill have the right to say to you, ‘How \\nis it; you pretend to be Frenchmen, and \\nyet you can neither speak nor write your \\nown language?’ But you are not the worst, \\npoor little Franz. We’ve all a great deal to \\nreproach ourselves with.”\\n“Your parents were not anxious \\nenough to have you learn. They preferred \\nto put you to work on a farm or at the \\nmills, so as to have a little more money. \\nAnd I? I’ve been to blame also. Have I not \\noften sent you to water my flowers instead \\nof learning your lessons? And when I \\nwanted to go fishing, did I not just give \\nyou a holiday?” \\nThen, from one thing to another, \\nM. Hamel went on to talk of the French \\nlanguage, saying that it was the most \\nbeautiful language in the world — the \\nclearest, the most logical; that we must \\nguard it among us and never forget it, \\nbecause when a people are enslaved, as \\nlong as they hold fast to their language it \\nis as if they had the key to their prison. \\nThen he opened a grammar and read \\nus our lesson. I was amazed to see how \\nwell I understood it. All he said seemed \\ne. \\x07What was Franz asked to tell? Was he \\nable to answer?\\nf. \\x07Why did M.Hamel blame himself?\\n10th English_Unit_6.indd   164\\n28-11-2022   18:59:44'),\n",

I think, too, that I had \\nnever listened so carefully, and that he had \\nnever explained everything with so much \\npatience. It seemed almost as if the poor \\nman wanted to give us all he knew before \\ngoing away, and to put it all into our heads \\nat one stroke. \\nAfter the grammar, we had a lesson \\nin writing. That day M. Hamel had new \\ncopies for us, written in a beautiful round \\nhand — France, Alsace, France, Alsace. \\nThey looked like little flags floating \\neverywhere in the school-room, hung \\nfrom the rod at the top of our desks. You \\nought to have seen how everyone set to \\nwork, and how quiet it was! The only \\nsound was the scratching of the pens over \\nthe paper. Once some beetles flew in; but \\nnobody paid any attention to them, not \\neven the littlest ones, who worked right \\non tracing their fish-hooks, as if that was \\nFrench, too. On the roof the pigeons cooed \\nvery low, and I thought to myself, “Will \\nthey make them sing in German, even the \\npigeons?” \\nWhenever I looked up from my \\nwriting I saw M. Hamel sitting motionless \\nin his chair and gazing first at one thing, \\nthen at another, as if he wanted to fix in his \\nmind just how everything looked in that \\nlittle school-room. Fancy! For forty years \\nhe had been there in the same place, with \\nhis garden outside the window and his \\nclass in front of him, just like that. Only \\nthe desks and benches had been worn \\nsmooth; the walnut-trees in the garden \\nwere taller, and the hopvine that he had \\nplanted himself twined about the windows \\nto the roof. How it must have broken his \\nheart to leave it all, poor man; to hear his \\nsister moving about in the room above, \\npacking their trunks! For they must leave \\nthe country next day. \\nBut he had the courage to hear every \\nlesson to the very last. After the writing, \\nwe had a lesson in history, and then the \\nbabies chanted their ba, be bi, bo, bu. Down \\nthere at the back of the room old Hauser \\nhad put on his spectacles and, holding his \\nprimer in both hands, spelled the letters \\nwith them. You could see that he, too, was \\ncrying; his voice trembled with emotion, \\nand it was so funny to hear him that we all \\nwanted to laugh and cry. Ah, how well I \\nremember it, that last lesson! \\nAll at once the church-clock struck \\ntwelve. Then  the Angelus. At the same \\nmoment the trumpets of the Prussians, \\nreturning from drill, sounded under our \\nwindows. M. Hamel stood up, very pale, \\nin his chair. I never saw him look so tall. \\n“My friends,” said he, “I—I—” But \\nsomething choked him. He could not go \\non. \\nThen he turned to the blackboard, \\ntook a piece of chalk, and, bearing on \\nwith all his might, he wrote as large as he \\ncould - “Vive La France!” \\nThen he stopped and leaned his head \\nagainst the wall, and, without a word, he \\nmade a gesture to us with his hand — \\n“School is dismissed — you may go.”\\ng. \\x07What did M.

However, it does not describe the \\n\\'winter\\' as being starved, but describes the \\npronoun \\'they\\'. Historically many wars \\nwere fought during the winter, while the \\nharvest season was essentially peaceful. \\n\\'They\\' refers to the soldiers in uniform \\nwho had to starve during winter while \\nfighting for their land.\\ne.g., Winter starv’d – transferred epithet\\nMetaphor\\nA figure of speech in which a word \\nor phrase is applied to an object or action \\nto which it is not literally applicable. \\nRecorded from the late 15th century, the \\nword comes via French and Latin from \\nGreek metaphora, from metapherein ‘to \\ntransfer’.\\ne.g., Hells of fire - metaphor\\nRepetition\\nPoets often repeat single words or \\nphrases, lines, and sometimes, even whole \\nstanzas at intervals to create a musical \\neffect; to emphasize a point; to draw the \\nreaders’ attention or to lend unity to a \\npiece.

Even \\nthe little children know the dikes must be \\nwatched every moment, and that a hole \\nno longer than your finger can be a very \\ndangerous thing. \\nMany years ago there lived in \\nHolland a boy named Peter.

Then, at \\n10.30, John Mathew answered his mail, \\nreturned phone calls and rearranged \\nhis social calendar helped by Louise, \\nhis secretary. At noon, John Mathew \\ndrove his Jaguar to the station and took \\na commuter train into Guindy for his \\nweekly lunch with Lalli and Lolly, his \\ntwo oldest and dearest friends. Then, on \\nto a little shopping. The 4:05 nonstop \\nwould bring him back to Tambaram. As \\nJohn Mathew drove up to the house at \\n5:00, Basky would have already set up the \\nmassage table and warmed the scented \\noils for a soothing herbal wrap. It was a \\ngruelling life but John seemed to thrive \\non it. On this Wednesday, however, there \\nwas an unexpected change of plans. Today \\nJohn’s shopping errand involved taking \\nhis diamond bracelet into the jeweller’s \\nfor cleaning. He threw the expensive jewel \\ninto his purse and proceeded on to lunch.\\nAs John waved his friends good-bye \\nand exited the restaurant, he sensed he \\nwas being followed.

A week before that \\nevent he sent for me; and here let me say \\nthat I had never set eyes on him. He hated \\nmy mother, but I do not know why. She \\ntold me long before his last illness that I \\nneed expect nothing from my father’s \\nbrother. He was an inventor, an able and \\ningenious mechanical engineer, and had \\nmuch money by his improvement in \\nturbine-wheels. He was a bachelor; lived \\nalone, cooked his own meals, and collected \\nprecious stones, especially rubies and \\npearls. From the time he made his first \\nmoney he had this mania. As he grew \\nricher, the desire to possess rare and costly \\ngems became stronger. When he bought a \\nnew stone, he carried it in his pocket for a \\nmonth and now and then took it out and \\nlooked at it. Then it was added to the \\ncollection in his safe at the trust company.\\nSupplementary\\n7\\nA Dilemma\\nSilas Weir Mitchell\\nAt the time he sent for \\nme I was a clerk, and poor \\nenough. \\nRemembering \\nmy mother’s words, his \\nmessage gave me, his sole \\nrelative, no new hopes; \\nbut I thought it best to go. \\nWhen I sat down by his bedside, he \\nbegan, with a malicious grin:\\n“I suppose you think me queer. \\nI will explain.” What he said was certainly \\nqueer enough. “I have been living on an \\nannuity into which I put my fortune. In \\nother words, I have been, as to money, \\nconcentric half of my life to enable me \\nto be as eccentric as I pleased the rest \\nof it. Now I repent of my wickedness to \\nyou all, and desire to live in the memory \\nof at least one of my family. You think I \\nam poor and have only my annuity. You \\nwill be profitably surprised. I have never \\nparted with my precious stones; they will \\nbe yours. You are my sole heir. I shall carry \\nwith me to the other world the satisfaction \\nof making one man happy. \\n“No doubt you have always had \\nexpectations, and I desire that you should \\ncontinue to expect. My jewels are in my \\nsafe. There is nothing else left”.\\nWhen I thanked him he grinned all \\nover his lean face, and said:\\n“You will have to pay for my funeral.”\\n10th English_Unit_7.indd   205\\n28-11-2022   18:51:06'),\n",

As I rose to go, he said:\\n“The rubies are valuable. They are in \\nmy safe at the trust company. Before you \\nunlock the box, be very careful to read a \\nletter which lies on top of it; and be sure \\nnot to shake the box.” I thought this odd. \\n“Don’t come back. It won’t hasten things.”\\nHe died that day next week, and was \\nhandsomely buried. The day after, his will \\nwas found, leaving me his heir. I opened \\nhis safe and found in it nothing but an \\niron box, evidently of his own making, for \\nhe was a skilled workman and very \\ningenious. The box was heavy and strong, \\nabout ten inches long, eight inches wide \\nand ten inches high. \\nOn it lay a letter to me. It ran thus:\\nI stood appalled, the key in my hand. Was it true? Was it a lie? I had spent all my \\nsavings on the funeral, and was poorer than ever.\\nRemembering the old man’s oddity, his malice, his cleverness in mechanic arts, and \\nthe patent explosive which had helped to make him rich, I began to feel how very likely it \\nwas that he had told the truth in this cruel letter. \\nI carried the iron box away to my lodgings, set it down with care in a closet, laid the \\nkey on it, and locked the closet. \\n “DEAR TOM: This box contains a \\nlarge number of very fine pigeon-blood \\nrubies and a fair lot of diamonds; one \\nis blue—a beauty. There are hundreds \\nof pearls—one the famous green pearl \\nand a necklace of blue pearls, for which \\nany woman would sell her soul—or her \\naffections.” I thought of Susan. “I wish \\nyou to continue to have expectations \\nand continuously to remember your dear \\nuncle. I would have left these stones to \\nsome charity, but I hate the poor as much \\nas I hate your mother’s son,—yes, rather \\nmore. The box contains an interesting \\nmechanism, which will act with certainty \\nas you unlock it, and explode ten ounces of \\nmy improved, supersensitive dynamite—\\nno, to be accurate, there are only nine \\nand a half ounces. Doubt me, and open it, \\nand you will be blown to atoms. Believe \\nme, and you will continue to nourish \\nexpectations which will never be fulfilled. \\nAs a considerate man, I counsel extreme \\ncare in handling the box. Don’t forget your \\naffectionate uncle”.\\n10th English_Unit_7.indd   206\\n28-11-2022   18:51:06'),\n",

For hours at a time I sat looking at \\nthat box and handling the key. \\nAt last I hung the key on my watch-\\nguard; but then it occurred to me that it \\nmight be lost or stolen. Dreading this, I \\nhid it, fearful that someone might use it to \\nopen the box. This state of doubt and fear \\nlasted for weeks, until I became nervous \\nand began to dread that some accident \\nmight happen to that box. A burglar might \\ncome and boldly carry it away and force \\nit open and find it was a wicked fraud of \\nmy uncle’s. Even the rumble and vibration \\ncaused by the heavy vans in the street \\nbecame at last a terror.\\nWorst of all, my salary was reduced, \\nand I saw that marriage was out of the \\nquestion.\\nIn my despair I consulted Professor \\nClinch about my dilemma, and as to some \\nsafe way of getting at the rubies. He said \\nthat, if my uncle had not lied, there was \\nnone that would not ruin the stones, \\nespecially the pearls, but that it was a silly \\ntale and altogether incredible. I offered \\nhim the biggest ruby if he wished to test \\nhis opinion.

I suspect that for \\na while I was “shadowed” as a suspicious, \\nand possibly criminal, character. I gave \\nup the libraries, and, becoming more and \\nmore fearful, set my precious box on a \\ndown pillow, for fear of its being shaken; \\nfor at this time even the absurd possibility \\nof its being disturbed by an earthquake \\ntroubled me. I tried to calculate the amount \\nof shake needed to explode my box.\\nThe old doctor, when I saw him \\nagain, begged me to give up all thought of \\nthe matter, and, as I felt how completely I \\nwas the slave of one despotic idea, I tried \\nto take the good advice thus given me.    \\nUnhappily, I found, soon after, \\nbetween the leaves of my uncle’s Bible, \\na numbered list of the stones with their \\ncost and much beside. It was dated two \\nyears before my uncle’s death. Many of \\nthe stones were well known, and their \\nenormous value amazed me.\\nSeveral of the rubies were described \\nwith care, and curious histories of them \\nwere given in detail. One was said to be the \\nfamous “Sunset ruby,” which had belonged \\nto the Empress-Queen Maria Theresa. \\nOne was called the “Blood ruby,” not, as \\nwas explained, because of the color, but on \\naccount of the murders it had occasioned. \\nNow, as I read, it seemed again to threaten \\ndeath.\\nThe pearls were described with care \\nas an unequalled collection. Concerning \\ntwo of them my uncle had written what I \\nmight call biographies—for, indeed, they \\nseemed to have done much evil and some \\ngood. One, a black pearl, was mentioned \\nin an old bill of sale as—She—which \\nseemed queer to me.\\nIt was maddening. Here, guarded \\nby a vision of sudden death, was wealth \\n“beyond the dreams of avarice.” I am not \\na clever or ingenious man; I know little \\nbeyond how to keep a ledger, and so I was, \\nand am, no doubt, absurd about many of \\nmy notions as to how to solve this riddle. \\nAt one time I thought of finding a \\nman who would take the risk of unlocking \\nthe box, but what right had I to subject \\nanyone else to the trial I dared not face? \\nI could easily drop the box from a height \\nsomewhere, and if it did not explode could \\nthen safely unlock it; but if it did blow up \\nwhen it fell, good-by to my rubies.

We parted the curtains of our hotel room and there \\nit was, Kanchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world! \\nThe entire range was in front of us in full view, snow-capped and \\ndazzling in the sun. Our trip started early in the morning the next \\nday. We woke up at 4 a.m. and reached Tiger hill at 5 a.m. to view \\nthe sunrise as the place has earned international fame for the best sunrise view. \\nTiger hill is situated at an altitude of 2590 meters and is 13 kilometers away from \\nthe city. Although Kanchenjunga was visible from the window of our hotel room, \\nviewing it from tiger hill was a different experience altogether. It was not a very \\ncloudy day so we were lucky enough to get a glimpse of the Mount Everest. After \\nTiger hill, we visited Senchal Lake which is another picnic spot nearby. We were \\ntold that the lake supplies drinking water to the city.\\nThe next spot on our list was Batasia Loop, a spiral railway near Ghum. The loop \\nis situated 5 kilometers from the city and is a gigantic railway loop where the \\ntoy train runs and takes a 360 degree turn. It is a beautiful place with manicured \\ngarden, streams and waterfalls. While travelling on the toy train, one gets a \\nbreath-taking view of Darjeeling’s scenic beauty. We would suggest the toy train \\nonly for people with lot of patience as the train travels at a speed of 15 kilometers \\nper hour and covers 14 kilometers in three hours which might  be  an  utter \\ndisappointment  for   some. Altogether we had a memorable and enjoyable school \\ntrip with our friends and it will linger in our thoughts forever.\\nA Short Story : \\nThree Simple Rules\\nThis Short Story Three Simple Rules is quite interesting to all the \\npeople. Enjoy reading this story. \\nOnce there was a rich man in Thailand. His name was Chulong. \\nHe was a very rich man. Yet he wanted more riches, more money. \\nOne day he was walking in his garden. He saw a strange bird in a bush. It was \\nvery small. But it had very beautiful and colorful features. Its voice was also very \\nsweet. Chulong had never seen such a bird in his life. He slowly went near the bush \\nunseen. He caught the bird. Now the bird began to speak. \\nUnit – 1\\nLISTENING PASSAGE\\n10th English_Listening Passage.indd   213\\n28-11-2022   18:30:19'),\n",

I can sell you for a big amount,” replied Chulong. \\n“But you are already rich. Why do you want more?” asked the bird. \\n“Because I want to become richer and richer,” replied Chulong. \\n“But do not dream of making money through me!” said the bird. It further \\nadded, “You can not sell me. Nobody will buy me, because, in imprisonment, I \\nlose my beauty and my sweet voice.” Then it slowly turned into a black bird. \\nThe beautiful features were now looking like the feathers of a crow. \\nChulong’s hopes of making money were shattered. He said angrily, “I will kill \\nyou, and I will eat your meat.” \\n“Eat me! I am so small. You will not get any meat out of me,” replied the bird. \\nChulong could not answer. The bird then suggested, “Well set me free. In return \\nI shall teach you three simple but useful rules.” \\n“What is the use of the rules? I want only money,” said Chulong. He was irritated. \\n“But these rules can profit you greatly,” added the bird. \\n“Profit me! Really? Then I shall set you free. But how can I trust you? You may \\nfly away,” said Chulong. \\n“I give you my word. And I always keep my word,” said the bird. \\nChulong wanted to take a chance. He released the bird. It flew up at once. Then it \\nsat on the branch of a tree. Its color started changing. It became beautiful again. \\nChulong asked, “Now teach me the rules.” \\n“Certainly,” said the bird. \\nThen it added, “The first rule is Never Believe everything others say. The second \\nrule is Never be sad about something you do not have. The third rule is Never \\nthrow away what you have in your hand.” \\n“You silly bird,” shouted Chulong. And he added, “These three rules are known \\nto every one. You have cheated me.” \\nBut the bird said, “Chulong, just sit down for a while. Think about all your actions of \\ntoday. You had me in your hands, but you threw me away (released me). You believed \\nall that I said. And you are sad about not having me. The rules are simple. But you \\nnever followed them. Now do you see the value of the rules?” so saying the bird flew \\naway and disappeared from his sight.\\nAcknowledgement - thanks to  \\nMr. E.

I asked him how he planned to carry his vision forward; what \\nwould he do for funds. But he replied, “What do I need funds for ? I have seeds and \\nmy cycle will take me to everywhere. Or I’ll take a bus”.\\nIf people called him asking for his number of varieties of seeds, he went directly to see \\nto it that they got what they wanted.

In order to better align with the DG’s long-\\nterm product roadmap, there is a new initiative to launch a TNT Sports product\\n[\\n] as soon as possible.  To facilitate this\\nrequest in such an expedited manner, the current plan of record is to reuse the Fuse client\\nframework & Bolt platform with as few modifications as possible, preferably without introducing\\nbespoke, one-off logic.  Unfortunately, primarily due to terms in existing partner contracts, TNT\\nSports must implement TVE in the strictest sense, which is not supported on the platform.  For\\nHBO Max and D+, WBD convinced partners to agree to a MVPD partner subscription model that\\nimplied account registration as a fundamental step to getting any gated content playback\\nentitlements.  Consequently, this ADD outlines a proposal for surgical updates to the Fuse client\\nframework & Bolt platform in implementing this new partner integration model, compromising\\nbetween time to market and the TVE requirements.\\nCurrent Architecture\\nThe current architecture assumes that “TV provider” customers effectively activate a native\\nWBD account supplying email (and optionally passwords), where all capabilities are conferred\\nby partner subscriptions associated to this registered account.  Accordingly, the UX itself\\ndirectly integrates partner setup within the traditional “sign up” workflows.

This practical example highlights the process of\\nconnecting to the MCP Server and managing browser instances for parallel test execution.\\nStep 1: Start the MCP Server\\nBefore connecting any clients, you first need to start the MCP Server. This is done by running the\\nfollowing command in your terminal:\\nnpx playwright launch –server\\nThis command initializes the Playwright MCP Server and makes it ready to accept incoming client\\nconnections. By launching the server, you’re allowing multiple clients to connect to a single browser\\ninstance, thus facilitating parallel testing and collaboration.\\nStep 2: Connect a Client to the Server\\nOnce the server is running, the next step is to connect a client to it. This is done by writing a script\\nthat connects to the Playwright instance using the connectOverCDP method. Here is an example of\\nhow to do it:\\nconst { chromium } = require(‘playwright’);\\n(async () => {\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0// Connect to the MCP Server\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(‘ws://localhost:PORT’);\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0// Create a new page and navigate to a URL\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0const page = await browser.newPage();\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0await page.goto(‘https://example.com’);\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0// Print the title of the page\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0console.log(await page.title());\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0// Close the browser\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0await browser.close();\\n})();\\nIn this script:\\nWe use chromium.connectOverCDP(‘ws://localhost:PORT’) to connect to the Playwright MCP Server. Replace PORT with\\nthe appropriate port number (e.g., 3000) used when launching the server.\\nWe then create a new browser page, navigate to “https://example.com,” print the page title to the console, and finally\\nclose the browser.\\nThis script demonstrates a simple use case of connecting to the MCP Server and interacting with a\\nweb page. You can expand this by running more complex tests, interacting with elements on the\\npage, and verifying test results.\\nStep 3: Add Multiple Clients to the Same Session\\nOne of the main advantages of using the Playwright MCP Server is the ability to run multiple clients\\nconnected to the same browser instance.

Clients Failing to Connect\\nIf your clients are unable to connect to the MCP Server, the following steps can help you resolve the\\nissue:\\nVerify MCP Server Status: Ensure that the MCP Server is running and accepting connections. You can check the server\\nlogs to verify if it’s listening on the specified port. Try accessing ws://localhost:PORT to confirm that the server is active.\\nNetwork and Firewall Settings: If you’re running the server on a network with firewalls or restrictive security settings,\\nthese might block the WebSocket connection between the client and the server. Ensure that the necessary ports are\\nopen and that security settings are not interfering with the connection. You can test the connection by temporarily\\ndisabling the firewall (if feasible) or using a different network to isolate the issue.\\nBest Practices\\nTo ensure efficient and effective use of Playwright MCP Server, here are some best practices:\\n1. Keep Playwright and Dependencies Updated\\nAlways keep Playwright and related dependencies up to date to ensure you benefit from the latest\\nbug fixes, performance improvements, and new features. This also reduces the risk of encountering\\ncompatibility issues.\\n2. Use Connection Pooling\\nIf you’re running multiple clients in parallel, consider using connection pooling to minimize\\noverhead. Reusing existing connections rather than repeatedly establishing new ones can\\nsignificantly improve performance.\\n3. Limit Simultaneous Client Connections\\nWhile the MCP Server supports multiple clients, too many simultaneous connections can overload\\nthe system, leading to slowdowns or failures. Monitor resource usage (such as memory and CPU)\\nand ensure you’re not exceeding the system’s capacity. Implement rate limiting or connection\\nthrottling if necessary.\\n4. Implement Error Handling\\nProper error handling in your scripts is crucial for stability. Always check for potential errors, such\\nas connection timeouts, failures to load pages, or network disruptions. Gracefully handle such\\nfailures to avoid crashes or inconsistent results.\\n5. Run Tests in Isolated Environments\\nTo avoid interference between different test scripts or clients, try running each set of tests in\\nisolated environments. This can be achieved by creating different browser contexts or tabs,'),\n",

Monitor System Resources\\nPlaywright MCP Server can consume significant system resources, especially when handling\\nmultiple clients. It’s important to monitor memory and CPU usage during test execution to ensure the\\nserver runs smoothly. Consider scaling your infrastructure or distributing load across multiple\\nmachines for large-scale testing.\\nPerformance Optimization Tips\\nTo ensure optimal performance while using Playwright MCP Server, especially in continuous\\nintegration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, it’s important to adopt strategies that reduce\\noverhead and enhance speed. Here are some tips to optimize performance:\\n1. Use Headless Mode for Faster Execution\\nRunning Playwright in headless mode (without opening a visible browser window) significantly\\nimproves test execution speed. This is especially useful in CI/CD pipelines, where the focus is on\\ntest performance and automation. Headless mode consumes fewer system resources and provides\\nfaster execution compared to running in full-browser mode.\\nTo launch Playwright in headless mode, use the following configuration in your test scripts:\\nconst browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });\\n2. Limit the Number of Concurrent Connections\\nWhile Playwright MCP Server can support multiple clients simultaneously, too many concurrent\\nconnections may cause performance bottlenecks. To prevent server overload or memory strain,\\nlimit the number of simultaneous connections that clients can establish. This can help avoid\\nunnecessary resource consumption and improve execution times.\\nYou can control concurrency by running a limited number of tests in parallel and monitoring the\\nsystem’s response to ensure stability.\\n3. Monitor Resource Usage and Scale Infrastructure\\nDuring test execution, particularly when running large test suites or simulations, monitor system\\nresources such as CPU, memory, and network usage. This allows you to identify any performance\\nissues and optimize the server environment accordingly.\\nIf you notice that your system is struggling to keep up with the load, consider scaling your\\ninfrastructure to handle the increased demands. You can distribute tests across multiple machines\\nor increase the available resources (e.g., RAM, CPU) to ensure smooth performance.\\nTo get a deeper understanding of resource usage and scaling infrastructure for Playwright MCP\\nServer, you can refer to additional resources like YouTube video.\\nConclusion\\nPlaywright MCP Server is a powerful extension to Playwright, enabling multi-client interactions with\\na single browser instance. It simplifies complex testing scenarios by allowing multiple users or\\nscripts to interact with the same session, thus improving collaboration and resource efficiency.\\nWhether you’re working on remote debugging, parallel test execution, or load testing, MCP Server\\noffers significant benefits that streamline your automated testing processes.\\nQA Touch can help streamline the integration of Playwright MCP Server into your testing workflows\\nby providing a centralized test management platform for tracking, and collaboration. It enables\\nteams to manage test cases efficiently, monitor progress, and generate detailed reports, ensuring'),\n",
