MCP Server Not Starting Properly\\nSometimes, the MCP Server might fail to start, which can interrupt your testing flow. Here are a few\\nthings to check:\\nPlaywright Installation: Ensure that Playwright is properly installed and up to date. You can check your Playwright\\nversion and install updates by running:\\nnpx playwright –version\\nnpx playwright install\\nPort Conflicts: The default port for MCP Server might be in use by another process, preventing the server from starting.\\nCheck if the default port (usually 3000) is being used by another application. You can either stop the conflicting process\\nor change the port by specifying a different one when launching the server:\\nnpx playwright launch –server –port=PORT_NUMBER'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Skia/PDF m117', 'creator': 'Chromium', 'creationdate': '2025-11-20T10:27:24+00:00', 'source': 'playwright-mcp-server.pdf', 'file_path': 'playwright-mcp-server.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-11-20T10:27:24+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20251120102724+00'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20251120102724+00'00'\", 'page': 7}, page_content='2. Clients Failing to Connect\\nIf your clients are unable to connect to the MCP Server, the following steps can help you resolve the\\nissue:\\nVerify MCP Server Status: Ensure that the MCP Server is running and accepting connections. You can check the server\\nlogs to verify if it’s listening on the specified port. Try accessing ws://localhost:PORT to confirm that the server is active.\\nNetwork and Firewall Settings: If you’re running the server on a network with firewalls or restrictive security settings,\\nthese might block the WebSocket connection between the client and the server. Ensure that the necessary ports are\\nopen and that security settings are not interfering with the connection. You can test the connection by temporarily\\ndisabling the firewall (if feasible) or using a different network to isolate the issue.\\nBest Practices\\nTo ensure efficient and effective use of Playwright MCP Server, here are some best practices:\\n1. Keep Playwright and Dependencies Updated\\nAlways keep Playwright and related dependencies up to date to ensure you benefit from the latest\\nbug fixes, performance improvements, and new features. This also reduces the risk of encountering\\ncompatibility issues.\\n2. Use Connection Pooling\\nIf you’re running multiple clients in parallel, consider using connection pooling to minimize\\noverhead. Reusing existing connections rather than repeatedly establishing new ones can\\nsignificantly improve performance.\\n3. Limit Simultaneous Client Connections\\nWhile the MCP Server supports multiple clients, too many simultaneous connections can overload\\nthe system, leading to slowdowns or failures. Monitor resource usage (such as memory and CPU)\\nand ensure you’re not exceeding the system’s capacity. Implement rate limiting or connection\\nthrottling if necessary.\\n4. Implement Error Handling\\nProper error handling in your scripts is crucial for stability. Always check for potential errors, such\\nas connection timeouts, failures to load pages, or network disruptions. Gracefully handle such\\nfailures to avoid crashes or inconsistent results.\\n5. Run Tests in Isolated Environments\\nTo avoid interference between different test scripts or clients, try running each set of tests in\\nisolated environments. This can be achieved by creating different browser contexts or tabs,'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Skia/PDF m117', 'creator': 'Chromium', 'creationdate': '2025-11-20T10:27:24+00:00', 'source': 'playwright-mcp-server.pdf', 'file_path': 'playwright-mcp-server.pdf', 'total_pages': 12, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-11-20T10:27:24+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20251120102724+00'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20251120102724+00'00'\", 'page': 8}, page_content='ensuring that tests don’t interfere with each other.\\n6. Monitor System Resources\\nPlaywright MCP Server can consume significant system resources, especially when handling\\nmultiple clients. It’s important to monitor memory and CPU usage during test execution to ensure the\\nserver runs smoothly. Consider scaling your infrastructure or distributing load across multiple\\nmachines for large-scale testing.\\nPerformance Optimization Tips\\nTo ensure optimal performance while using Playwright MCP Server, especially in continuous\\nintegration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, it’s important to adopt strategies that reduce\\noverhead and enhance speed. Here are some tips to optimize performance:\\n1. Use Headless Mode for Faster Execution\\nRunning Playwright in headless mode (without opening a visible browser window) significantly\\nimproves test execution speed. This is especially useful in CI/CD pipelines, where the focus is on\\ntest performance and automation. Headless mode consumes fewer system resources and provides\\nfaster execution compared to running in full-browser mode.\\nTo launch Playwright in headless mode, use the following configuration in your test scripts:\\nconst browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });\\n2. Limit the Number of Concurrent Connections\\nWhile Playwright MCP Server can support multiple clients simultaneously, too many concurrent\\nconnections may cause performance bottlenecks. To prevent server overload or memory strain,\\nlimit the number of simultaneous connections that clients can establish. This can help avoid\\nunnecessary resource consumption and improve execution times.\\nYou can control concurrency by running a limited number of tests in parallel and monitoring the\\nsystem’s response to ensure stability.\\n3. Monitor Resource Usage and Scale Infrastructure\\nDuring test execution, particularly when running large test suites or simulations, monitor system\\nresources such as CPU, memory, and network usage. This allows you to identify any performance\\nissues and optimize the server environment accordingly.\\nIf you notice that your system is struggling to keep up with the load, consider scaling your\\ninfrastructure to handle the increased demands.
